## issues

- On prod env, when trying to upload a file, the file input turn red
It still works but it turn raid still.

- in local dev env, the videos seems not to load on safari browser

- the hook useIsMobile does not handle any resize event.
It is a problem for the demo if the user tries responsive by changing it's browser size
But it's not a big deal since users usually never do so
